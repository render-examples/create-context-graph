# Building Your First Linear Context Graph

:::info Time & difficulty
**Time:** ~15-20 minutes | **Level:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Neo4j, Linear API key
:::

This tutorial walks you through importing your real Linear workspace data into a Neo4j context graph and querying it with an AI agent. By the end, you'll have a running app where you can ask natural language questions about your issues, projects, cycles, and team workload -- backed by a connected graph of your actual project data.

## What you'll build

A full-stack application that:

- Imports your Linear issues, projects, cycles, teams, users, labels, and workflow states into Neo4j
- Maps all Linear relationships (issue assignments, project membership, cycle tracking, sub-issue hierarchies) into graph edges
- Provides an AI agent that can traverse the graph to answer questions like "What's blocking the v2 launch?" or "Who has bandwidth this cycle?"
- Visualizes the graph interactively with the NVL graph component

<!-- TODO: Export from linear-data-flow.excalidraw: ![Data flow from Linear API to the knowledge graph application](/img/linear-data-flow.png) -->

### Agent tools

The generated agent includes these domain tools for querying the knowledge graph:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_developer` | Search for developers by name or role |
| `get_service_health` | Get the health status and dependencies of a service |
| `find_similar_incidents` | Find past incidents similar to a current one |
| `get_deployment_history` | Get deployment history for a service |
| `get_pr_impact` | Trace the impact of a pull request through deployments and incidents |
| `list_repositories` | List Repository records with optional limit |
| `get_repository_by_name` | Get a specific Repository by name with all connections |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.11+** -- check with `python3 --version`
- **Node.js 18+** -- check with `node --version`
- **Neo4j** -- one of:
  - [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io) (free cloud instance)
  - Docker: `docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:5`
  - neo4j-local: `npx @johnymontana/neo4j-local`
- **uv** (recommended) -- install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **A Linear API key** -- see Step 1 below
- **An LLM API key** -- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for most frameworks) or `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` depending on your framework choice

:::caution Python version errors
If you see `requires-python >= 3.11` errors during installation, your active Python is too old. Common fixes:
- **pyenv**: `pyenv install 3.12 && pyenv local 3.12`
- **Homebrew (macOS)**: `brew install python@3.12`
- **Ubuntu (deadsnakes PPA)**: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && sudo apt install python3.12`
- **uv**: `uv python install 3.12`

Check with `python3 --version` (not just `python --version`, which may point to an older version on some systems).
:::

## Step 1: Create a Linear API Key

1. Open Linear and go to **Settings > Security & Access > API** (or navigate directly to `linear.app/settings/api`).
2. Click **Create key** to generate a personal API key.
3. Copy the key -- it starts with `lin_api_`. You'll use this in the next step.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: ![Linear API settings page with Create key button](/img/linear-api-key.png) -->

:::tip
Linear API keys have read access to your entire workspace. The import is read-only -- nothing is written back to Linear.
:::

## Step 2: Scaffold the Project (~2 min)

Run the CLI with the `--connector linear` flag:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-linear-app \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --connector linear \
  --linear-api-key lin_api_xxxxx
```

Replace `lin_api_xxxxx` with your actual API key. You can also set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx
uvx create-context-graph my-linear-app \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --connector linear
```

### Filtering by team

If your workspace has multiple teams and you only want to import one, add the `--linear-team` flag with the team's URL key (the short code you see in Linear URLs, like `ENG` or `PROD`):

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-linear-app \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --connector linear \
  --linear-team ENG
```

### What happens during scaffolding

The CLI will:

1. **Validate your API key** by calling Linear's `viewer` query
2. **Fetch your workspace data** -- teams, users, labels, projects, cycles, and issues (with cursor-based pagination for large workspaces)
3. **Transform the data** into the POLE+O entity model used by neo4j-agent-memory
4. **Write it to `data/fixtures.json`** in the generated project
5. **Generate the full application** -- FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, Neo4j schema, and AI agent

You'll see output like:

```
Importing data from connected services...
  Connecting to Linear...
  Fetching data from Linear...
  ✓ Linear: 342 entities, 89 documents
```

## Step 3: Configure and Seed (~3 min)

Navigate to your project:

```bash
cd my-linear-app
```

**Configure your environment** by copying the example file and editing it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
# .env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

:::tip Using Neo4j Aura?
If you're using Neo4j Aura, set `NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io` with the connection URI from your Aura console.
:::

**Install dependencies** for both backend and frontend:

```bash
make install
```

**Verify your Neo4j connection** (optional but recommended):

```bash
make test-connection
```

**Seed the data** into Neo4j:

```bash
make seed
```

This loads entities, relationships, and documents from `data/fixtures.json` into your Neo4j instance. You should see output similar to:

```
Creating schema constraints and indexes...
Loading fixture data...
  Created 342 entities across 12 node labels
  Created 1024 relationships across 26 relationship types
  Created 89 documents with MENTIONS links
  Created 15 decision traces
Done. Knowledge graph ready.
```

## Step 4: Start the Application (~1 min)

The application has two components: a FastAPI backend (port 8000) and a Next.js frontend (port 3000).

**Using `make start` (recommended):**

```bash
make start
```

This runs both the backend and frontend concurrently. You should see:

```
Starting backend on http://localhost:8000...
Starting frontend on http://localhost:3000...
```

**Alternative: two separate terminals** (useful for debugging):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend && make dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Once both are running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: ![Application loaded with Linear data](/img/linear-app-loaded.png) -->

## Step 5: Explore Your Linear Data as a Graph

### Schema view

When the app loads, you'll see the **graph schema view** showing the entity types and relationships imported from Linear:

<!-- TODO: Export from linear-graph-schema.excalidraw: ![Linear context graph schema showing entity types and relationships](/img/linear-graph-schema.png) -->

- **Issue** nodes connected to **Person** (via ASSIGNED_TO, CREATED_BY), **Project** (via BELONGS_TO_PROJECT), **Cycle** (via IN_CYCLE), **Team** (via BELONGS_TO_TEAM), **Label** (via HAS_LABEL), **WorkflowState** (via HAS_STATE), and **ProjectMilestone** (via IN_MILESTONE)
- **Issue** → **Issue** relationships: **CHILD_OF** (sub-issues), **BLOCKS**, **BLOCKED_BY**, **RELATED_TO**, **DUPLICATE_OF**
- **Comment** nodes with threading: **HAS_COMMENT** from Issues, **REPLY_TO** between comments, **RESOLVED_BY** linking to the person who resolved a thread
- **Project** nodes with **HAS_MILESTONE** → ProjectMilestone, **HAS_UPDATE** → ProjectUpdate
- **Initiative** nodes (top-level planning) with **CONTAINS_PROJECT** → Project, **OWNED_BY** → Person
- **Attachment** nodes linked to issues via **HAS_ATTACHMENT** (Figma, GitHub PRs, Slack messages)
- **Person** nodes connected to **Team** and **Project** (via MEMBER_OF)

Double-click any schema node to load actual instances of that type.

### Decision traces from issue history

The connector automatically transforms issue history into **decision traces** -- the same format used by neo4j-agent-memory for reasoning memory. Each issue with 2+ history entries generates a trace:

- **Task**: "Lifecycle of ENG-101 Fix login bug"
- **Steps**: Each state transition, assignment change, or priority change becomes a thought/action/observation triple
- **Outcome**: Derived from the issue's current state (completed, canceled, or in-progress)

This means the agent can answer questions like "What decisions were made about ENG-101?" or "How did this issue get to its current state?" by traversing the decision trace graph.

### Ask the agent

Try these questions in the chat panel:

- **"What issues are assigned to [your name]?"** -- Finds your open assignments
- **"Show me all issues in the current cycle"** -- Traverses Cycle relationships
- **"What's the status of the [project name] project?"** -- Aggregates issue states for a project
- **"Find all issues labeled Bug with High priority"** -- Filters by label and priority
- **"What's blocking ENG-101?"** -- Traverses BLOCKS/BLOCKED_BY relations between issues
- **"Who is working on the most issues right now?"** -- Aggregates assignments across team members
- **"What are the milestones for the v2 Launch project?"** -- Traverses HAS_MILESTONE relationships
- **"Show me the latest project updates"** -- Finds ProjectUpdate nodes with health status
- **"What decisions were made about ENG-101?"** -- Traverses DecisionTrace → TraceStep chains
- **"Are there any resolved comment threads?"** -- Finds comments with RESOLVED_BY relationships

The agent uses Cypher queries to traverse your graph, so it can answer multi-hop questions that would require clicking through multiple Linear views.

### Graph visualization

As you chat with the agent, the graph visualization updates in real-time. Each tool call result flows into the graph view, showing the nodes and relationships that the agent queried. You can:

- **Double-click** a node to expand its neighbors
- **Drag** nodes to rearrange the layout
- **Click** a node to see its properties
- Use the **"Ask about this"** button to send a query about a specific entity

## Understanding the Graph Schema

The Linear connector maps your data to the **POLE+O entity model** used by neo4j-agent-memory. POLE+O categorizes every entity as one of five types: **P**erson, **O**rganization (teams, companies), **L**ocation, **E**vent (time-bounded occurrences), or **O**bject (everything else -- issues, labels, workflow states). This classification enables cross-domain queries when combining multiple connectors.

| Linear Concept | Graph Label | POLE Type | Example Properties |
|---|---|---|---|
| Issue | `Issue` | Object | identifier, title, priority, stateType, dueDate, branchName, completedAt |
| Project | `Project` | Organization | name, state, progress, health, targetDate |
| Cycle (Sprint) | `Cycle` | Event | name, number, startsAt, endsAt, progress |
| Team | `Team` | Organization | name, key |
| User | `Person` | Person | name, email, displayName |
| Label | `Label` | Object | name, color |
| Workflow State | `WorkflowState` | Object | name, type (triage/backlog/started/completed) |
| Comment | `Comment` | Object | body, createdAt, resolvedAt |
| Project Update | `ProjectUpdate` | Object | body, health (onTrack/atRisk/offTrack), createdAt |
| Project Milestone | `ProjectMilestone` | Event | name, targetDate, status, progress |
| Initiative | `Initiative` | Organization | name, status (Planned/Active/Completed), health |
| Attachment | `Attachment` | Object | title, url, sourceType (figma, github, slack, etc.) |

Issue names follow the format `"ENG-101 Fix login bug"` (identifier + title) so they're easy to reference in queries.

### Relationship types

The full set of relationship types imported:

| Relationship | From | To | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ASSIGNED_TO` | Issue | Person | Issue assignee |
| `CREATED_BY` | Issue | Person | Issue creator |
| `BELONGS_TO_PROJECT` | Issue | Project | Issue in project |
| `BELONGS_TO_TEAM` | Issue | Team | Issue team |
| `IN_CYCLE` | Issue | Cycle | Issue in sprint |
| `HAS_STATE` | Issue | WorkflowState | Current workflow state |
| `HAS_LABEL` | Issue | Label | Applied labels |
| `CHILD_OF` | Issue | Issue | Sub-issue hierarchy |
| `BLOCKS` | Issue | Issue | Blocking dependency |
| `BLOCKED_BY` | Issue | Issue | Blocked by dependency |
| `RELATED_TO` | Issue | Issue | Related issues |
| `DUPLICATE_OF` | Issue | Issue | Duplicate link |
| `IN_MILESTONE` | Issue | ProjectMilestone | Issue in milestone |
| `HAS_COMMENT` | Issue | Comment | Issue comments |
| `HAS_ATTACHMENT` | Issue | Attachment | Linked external resources |
| `REPLY_TO` | Comment | Comment | Threaded reply |
| `AUTHORED_BY` | Comment | Person | Comment author |
| `RESOLVED_BY` | Comment | Person | Thread resolver |
| `HAS_UPDATE` | Project | ProjectUpdate | Status updates |
| `POSTED_BY` | ProjectUpdate | Person | Update author |
| `HAS_MILESTONE` | Project | ProjectMilestone | Project milestones |
| `CONTAINS_PROJECT` | Initiative | Project | Initiative grouping |
| `OWNED_BY` | Initiative | Person | Initiative owner |
| `MEMBER_OF` | Person | Team/Project | Membership |
| `LEADS` | Person | Project | Project lead |
| `CYCLE_FOR` | Cycle | Team | Cycle belongs to team |

## Re-importing Updated Data

As your Linear workspace changes, you can re-import to keep the graph current:

```bash
# Re-import from Linear
make import

# Re-import and seed into Neo4j
make import-and-seed
```

The import uses MERGE operations, so re-importing is safe -- existing nodes are updated rather than duplicated.

These targets read credentials from your `.env` file:

```bash
# .env
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx
LINEAR_TEAM=ENG  # optional
```

## Example Cypher Queries

Once your data is in Neo4j, you can also run raw Cypher queries via the agent's `run_cypher` tool or directly in Neo4j Browser (`http://localhost:7474`):

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: ![Neo4j Browser showing Linear query results](/img/linear-neo4j-browser.png) -->

### Find all issues related to an issue by shared labels

```cypher
MATCH (i:Issue {identifier: 'ENG-101'})-[:HAS_LABEL]->(l)<-[:HAS_LABEL]-(related:Issue)

## Privacy and Security

The Linear connector is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Read-only access**: The API key is used for read-only queries. Nothing is written back to Linear.
- **Scoped by team**: Use `--linear-team` to limit the import to a single team's data.
- **Credentials stored locally**: Your Linear API key is stored in `.env` in your project directory, which is included in `.gitignore`.
- **No external dependencies**: The connector uses Python's built-in `urllib` -- no third-party API client libraries required at runtime.

:::caution
If you import workspace data into a cloud Neo4j instance (e.g., Neo4j Aura), be aware that your issue titles, descriptions, comments, and team member names will be stored in the cloud. For sensitive workspaces, use a local Neo4j instance.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### `make seed` fails with a connection error

Ensure Neo4j is running and your `.env` credentials are correct:

```bash
make test-connection
```

If this fails, verify that `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file match your Neo4j instance.

### Linear API key invalid or expired

If you see authentication errors during scaffold, verify your API key:
- It should start with `lin_api_`
- Generate a new one at **Settings > Security & Access > API** in Linear

### Team key not found

If you use `--linear-team` with an incorrect key, the connector will list all available team keys in your workspace. Check that you're using the URL key (e.g., `ENG`) not the team name.

### No data imported (0 entities)

If the import completes but shows 0 entities:
- Try without the `--linear-team` filter to import all teams
- Ensure your API key has access to the workspace (not just a specific team)

### Python version error during scaffold

See the Python version guidance in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above.

### Port already in use

The backend uses port 8000 and the frontend uses port 3000. If either port is occupied:

```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

## Next Steps

- **Add more connectors** -- Combine Linear with GitHub (`--connector linear --connector github`) to create a unified development graph linking issues to PRs and commits
- **Customize the domain** -- Edit `data/ontology.yaml` to add domain-specific entity types and tools
- **Build custom agent tools** -- Add Cypher-powered tools to the agent for your specific workflow patterns
- **Set up periodic sync** -- Run `make import-and-seed` on a schedule to keep the graph fresh
- **Enable debug logging** -- Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see detailed import progress including entity counts, pagination, and rate limit status
