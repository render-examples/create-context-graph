# Build a Developer Knowledge Graph from Claude Code Sessions

:::info Time & difficulty
**Time:** ~15-20 minutes | **Level:** Intermediate | **Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Neo4j, Claude Code
:::

This tutorial walks you through importing your Claude Code session history into a Neo4j context graph. Every session you've had with Claude Code -- the files you edited, the decisions you made, the errors you fixed, and the preferences you expressed -- becomes a connected, queryable knowledge graph.

By the end, you'll have an AI agent that can answer questions like "Why did we switch from REST to GraphQL?", "What files did I modify most last week?", and "What are my coding preferences across all projects?".

## What you'll build

A full-stack application that:

- Imports your local Claude Code session files (`.jsonl` format) into Neo4j -- **no API keys or authentication required**
- Extracts **decision traces** from user corrections, error-resolution cycles, and deliberation patterns
- Identifies **developer preferences** from explicit statements ("always use single quotes") and behavioral patterns (package install frequency)
- Maps tool call sequences into **reasoning chains** showing how the agent solved each task
- Provides **8 session intelligence agent tools** for querying your development history
- Automatically **redacts secrets** (API keys, tokens, passwords) before storing content

### Agent tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_sessions` | Full-text search across session message content |
| `decision_history` | Find decisions related to a file, package, or topic |
| `file_timeline` | File modification and read history across sessions |
| `error_patterns` | Recurring errors and how they were resolved |
| `tool_usage_stats` | Tool usage analytics across sessions |
| `my_preferences` | Extracted preferences, optionally filtered by category |
| `project_overview` | Summary stats for one or all projects |
| `reasoning_trace` | Tool call chain for a specific session |

### How it works

![Data flow from Claude Code sessions to the knowledge graph application](/img/claude-code-data-flow.png)

The CLI reads your local Claude Code session files, extracts entities (files, decisions, preferences, errors) and relationships, scaffolds a full-stack application, and seeds the data into Neo4j. The generated agent uses the 8 tools above to query the graph and answer questions about your development history.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.11+** -- check with `python3 --version`
- **Node.js 18+** -- check with `node --version`
- **Neo4j** -- one of:
  - [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io) (free cloud instance)
  - Docker: `docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:5`
  - neo4j-local: `npx @johnymontana/neo4j-local`
- **uv** (recommended) -- install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Claude Code session history** -- at least one session in `~/.claude/projects/`
- **An LLM API key** (required for the chat agent) -- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for most frameworks) or `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` depending on your framework choice

:::caution Python version errors
If you see `requires-python >= 3.11` errors during installation, your active Python is too old. Common fixes:
- **pyenv**: `pyenv install 3.12 && pyenv local 3.12`
- **Homebrew (macOS)**: `brew install python@3.12`
- **Ubuntu (deadsnakes PPA)**: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && sudo apt install python3.12`
- **uv**: `uv python install 3.12`

Check with `python3 --version` (not just `python --version`, which may point to an older version on some systems).
:::

:::tip Check for session data
You can check if you have Claude Code session data by running:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/projects/
```
Each directory represents a project, with session files (`.jsonl` format) inside containing your session history.
:::

## How Claude Code stores session data

Claude Code saves every session as a JSONL file in `~/.claude/projects/`, organized by project path:

```
~/.claude/projects/
  -Users-will-projects-my-api/          # Project directory (encoded path)
    a1b2c3d4-session-uuid.jsonl         # Session file
    e5f6g7h8-session-uuid.jsonl
  -Users-will-projects-frontend/
    ...
```

Each JSONL file contains a timestamped sequence of:
- **User messages** -- your prompts and corrections
- **Assistant messages** -- Claude's responses with tool_use blocks (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- **Tool results** -- outputs from each tool call, including errors
- **Progress entries** -- subagent activity from Agent tool invocations

This structured data is a natural fit for a context graph -- every session is a conversation with entities (files, packages, decisions), relationships (tool calls that modify files, errors that get resolved), and temporal chains.

## Step 1: Scaffold the Project (~2 min)

Run the CLI with the `--connector claude-code` flag:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-dev-graph \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework claude-agent-sdk \
  --connector claude-code
```

By default, the connector imports sessions from the project matching your current working directory. To import from all projects:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-dev-graph \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework claude-agent-sdk \
  --connector claude-code \
  --claude-code-scope all
```

The import runs immediately during scaffolding:

```
Importing data from connected services...
  Connecting to Claude Code...
  Fetching data from Claude Code...
  ✓ Claude Code: 342 entities, 12 documents
```

### Customizing the import

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--claude-code-scope` | `current` | `current` imports sessions matching your cwd; `all` imports every project |
| `--claude-code-project` | -- | Explicit project path to filter (e.g., `/Users/will/projects/my-api`) |
| `--claude-code-since` | all time | ISO date; only import sessions modified after this date |
| `--claude-code-max-sessions` | `0` (all) | Limit the number of sessions imported (most recent first) |
| `--claude-code-content` | `truncated` | `full` stores complete message text, `truncated` limits to 2000 chars, `none` stores metadata only |

### Import a specific project with a time window

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-api-graph \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --connector claude-code \
  --claude-code-project /Users/will/projects/my-api \
  --claude-code-since 2026-03-01 \
  --claude-code-max-sessions 50
```

## Step 2: Configure and Seed (~3 min)

Navigate to your project:

```bash
cd my-dev-graph
```

**Configure your environment.** The scaffolded project generates a `.env` file with working Neo4j defaults. Edit it with your credentials:

```bash
# .env (already generated — edit in place, don't overwrite)
NEO4J_URI=neo4j://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password          # change to match your Neo4j instance
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...     # required for the chat agent in Step 4
```

:::warning API key required for chat
The chat agent in Step 4 requires an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` depending on your framework). Without it, the graph visualization, document browser, and decision trace viewer will work, but the chat panel will return an error.
:::

:::tip Using Neo4j Aura?
If you're using Neo4j Aura, set `NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io` with the connection URI from your Aura console.
:::

**Install dependencies** for both backend and frontend:

```bash
make install
```

**Verify your Neo4j connection** (optional but recommended):

```bash
make test-connection
```

**Seed the data** into Neo4j:

```bash
make seed
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Creating schema constraints and indexes...
Loading fixture data...
  Created 342 entities across 10 node labels
  Created 856 relationships across 14 relationship types
  Created 12 documents with MENTIONS links
  Created 4 decision traces
Done. Knowledge graph ready.
```

:::tip Verify the seed
To confirm your data loaded correctly, you can query the Neo4j instance directly:

```bash
make test-connection
```

This should print "Neo4j connection successful". The exact entity counts depend on the number and size of your Claude Code sessions.
:::

## Step 3: Start the Application (~1 min)

The application has two components: a FastAPI backend (port 8000) and a Next.js frontend (port 3000).

**Using `make start` (recommended):**

```bash
make start
```

This runs both the backend and frontend concurrently. You should see:

```
Starting backend on http://localhost:8000...
Starting frontend on http://localhost:3000...
```

**Alternative: two separate terminals** (useful for debugging):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend && make dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Once both are running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: ![Application loaded with Claude Code session data](/img/claude-code-app-loaded.png) -->

## Step 4: Explore Your Session Graph (~10 min)

### Schema view

When the app loads, the graph visualization shows the schema view -- the entity types and relationships imported from your sessions:

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: ![Schema view showing session graph entity types](/img/claude-code-schema-view.png) -->

![Claude Code session graph schema showing entity types and relationships](/img/claude-code-graph-schema.png)

- **Project** nodes representing each project directory, connected to **Session** nodes via `HAS_SESSION`
- **Session** nodes linked to **Message** nodes via `HAS_MESSAGE`, with `NEXT` chains preserving conversation order
- **ToolCall** nodes connected to Messages via `USED_TOOL`, with `PRECEDED_BY` chains showing reasoning sequences
- **File** nodes linked from ToolCalls via `MODIFIED_FILE` and `READ_FILE`
- **Decision** nodes (extracted from corrections and deliberations) with `CHOSE` and `REJECTED` alternatives
- **Preference** nodes capturing your coding style, framework choices, and tool configuration
- **Error** nodes linked to the ToolCalls that produced them via `ENCOUNTERED_ERROR`
- **GitBranch** nodes connected to Sessions via `ON_BRANCH`

Double-click any schema node to load actual instances.

### Ask the agent about your sessions

The agent has 8 session intelligence tools available:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `search_sessions` | Full-text search across session message content |
| `decision_history` | Find decisions related to a file, package, or topic |
| `file_timeline` | Show modification/read history of a file across sessions |
| `error_patterns` | Find recurring errors and how they were resolved |
| `tool_usage_stats` | Analytics on tool usage across sessions |
| `my_preferences` | Retrieve extracted preferences, optionally by category |
| `project_overview` | Summary stats for a project or all projects |
| `reasoning_trace` | Trace the tool call chain for a specific session |

Try these questions in the chat panel:

- **"What decisions have I made about authentication?"** -- Searches Decision nodes by keyword
- **"Show me the history of config.py"** -- File modification timeline across all sessions
- **"What errors have I encountered most often?"** -- Error frequency and resolution patterns
- **"What are my coding preferences?"** -- Lists extracted preferences with confidence scores
- **"What tools do I use most?"** -- Tool usage analytics across sessions
- **"Give me an overview of my projects"** -- Session counts, token usage, decision counts
- **"Trace the reasoning for yesterday's session"** -- Tool call sequence with inputs/outputs
- **"Search my sessions for GraphQL"** -- Full-text search across message content

### Graph visualization

As you chat with the agent, the graph visualization updates in real-time:

- **Double-click** a Session node to see its messages, tool calls, and decisions
- **Double-click** a File node to see all sessions that touched it
- **Double-click** a Decision node to see the alternatives that were considered and rejected
- **Click** any node to inspect its properties in the detail panel
- Use the **"Ask about this"** button to query a specific entity

## Understanding the Graph Schema

### Entity types

| Session Concept | Graph Label | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| Project directory | `Project` | name (decoded path), encodedPath, sessionCount |
| JSONL session file | `Session` | sessionId, startedAt, endedAt, branch, messageCount, totalInputTokens, totalOutputTokens |
| User/assistant message | `Message` | uuid, role, content (truncated), timestamp |
| Tool invocation | `ToolCall` | toolName, input, output, isError, timestamp |
| Source code file | `File` | path, language, modificationCount, readCount |
| Git branch | `GitBranch` | name, project |
| Tool call error | `Error` | message, timestamp |
| Extracted decision | `Decision` | description, category, confidence, outcome |
| Decision option | `Alternative` | description, wasChosen, reason |
| Coding preference | `Preference` | category, value, confidence, sessionCount |

### Relationship types

| Relationship | From | To | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HAS_SESSION` | Project | Session | Project contains session |
| `HAS_MESSAGE` | Session | Message | Session contains message |
| `NEXT` | Message | Message | Sequential message order |
| `USED_TOOL` | Message | ToolCall | Assistant invoked a tool |
| `PRECEDED_BY` | ToolCall | ToolCall | Tool call sequence (reasoning chain) |
| `MODIFIED_FILE` | ToolCall | File | Write/Edit tool changed a file |
| `READ_FILE` | ToolCall | File | Read/Grep/Glob tool accessed a file |
| `ON_BRANCH` | Session | GitBranch | Session was on this git branch |
| `ENCOUNTERED_ERROR` | ToolCall | Error | Tool call produced an error |
| `MADE_DECISION` | Session | Decision | Decision was made during session |
| `CHOSE` | Decision | Alternative | The chosen approach |
| `REJECTED` | Decision | Alternative | A rejected approach |
| `RESULTED_IN` | Decision | ToolCall | Action taken after decision |
| `EXPRESSES_PREFERENCE` | Message | Preference | Message reveals a preference |

### Decision extraction

The connector identifies four types of decisions automatically:

![Four types of decision extraction from Claude Code sessions](/img/claude-code-decision-extraction.png)

1. **User corrections** -- When you redirect Claude's approach ("No, use OAuth2 instead of JWT"), the original approach becomes a rejected alternative and your correction becomes the chosen one.

2. **Deliberation markers** -- When Claude discusses trade-offs ("We could use FastAPI or Flask, the trade-off is..."), the alternatives and reasoning are captured.

3. **Error-resolution cycles** -- When a tool call fails and Claude fixes it, the error and resolution are linked as a decision about how to fix the problem.

4. **Dependency changes** -- Package install commands (`pip install`, `npm install`, etc.) are captured as dependency decisions.

Each decision includes a confidence score (0.0--1.0) indicating how certain the extractor is that this is a real decision point.

### Preference extraction

Preferences are extracted from two sources:

- **Explicit statements** -- Messages like "always use single quotes", "prefer FastAPI over Flask", "use ruff for linting" are detected via pattern matching.
- **Package frequency** -- Packages installed across multiple sessions indicate framework preferences (e.g., always installing `pytest` and `ruff`).

Each preference includes a category (`coding_style`, `framework_choice`, `testing_approach`, `tool_configuration`, `naming_convention`, `documentation`) and a confidence score that increases when the same preference appears across multiple sessions.

## Example Cypher Queries

Run these in Neo4j Browser (`http://localhost:7474`) or via the agent's `run_cypher` tool:

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: ![Neo4j Browser showing query results](/img/claude-code-neo4j-browser.png) -->

### Most-modified files across all sessions

```cypher
MATCH (f:File)
WHERE f.modificationCount > 0
RETURN f.path AS file, f.language AS language,
       f.modificationCount AS modifications,
       f.readCount AS reads
ORDER BY f.modificationCount DESC
LIMIT 20
```

Example result:

| file | language | modifications | reads |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| `src/api/routes.py` | python | 14 | 38 |
| `src/models/user.py` | python | 9 | 22 |
| `tests/test_auth.py` | python | 7 | 15 |

### Decision history for a specific file

```cypher
MATCH (d:Decision)-[:RESULTED_IN]->(:ToolCall)-[:MODIFIED_FILE]->(f:File)
WHERE f.path CONTAINS 'config'
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[:CHOSE]->(chosen:Alternative)
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[:REJECTED]->(rejected:Alternative)
RETURN d.description AS decision, d.category AS type,
       chosen.description AS chosen_approach,
       rejected.description AS rejected_approach,
       d.timestamp AS when
ORDER BY d.timestamp DESC
```

Example result:

| decision | type | chosen_approach | rejected_approach | when |
|----------|------|----------------|-------------------|------|
| Switch auth config to OAuth2 | correction | Use OAuth2 with PKCE | JWT with refresh tokens | 2026-03-28T14:22:00 |
| Add rate limiting config | deliberation | Token bucket algorithm | Fixed window counter | 2026-03-25T10:15:00 |

### Error patterns and resolutions

```cypher
MATCH (e:Error)<-[:ENCOUNTERED_ERROR]-(tc:ToolCall)
RETURN e.message AS error, tc.toolName AS tool,
       count(*) AS occurrences
ORDER BY occurrences DESC
LIMIT 15
```

Example result:

| error | tool | occurrences |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'` | Bash | 4 |
| `SyntaxError: unexpected indent` | Edit | 3 |
| `FileNotFoundError: config.yaml` | Read | 2 |

### Tool usage breakdown

```cypher
MATCH (tc:ToolCall)
RETURN tc.toolName AS tool, count(*) AS usage_count
ORDER BY usage_count DESC
```

Example result:

| tool | usage_count |
|------|-------------|
| Read | 245 |
| Edit | 128 |
| Bash | 97 |
| Write | 43 |
| Grep | 38 |

### All extracted preferences

```cypher
MATCH (p:Preference)
RETURN p.value AS preference, p.category AS category,
       p.confidence AS confidence, p.sessionCount AS seen_in_sessions
ORDER BY p.confidence DESC
```

Example result:

| preference | category | confidence | seen_in_sessions |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Use ruff for linting | tool_configuration | 0.92 | 8 |
| Prefer pytest over unittest | testing_approach | 0.85 | 6 |
| Use single quotes for strings | coding_style | 0.78 | 5 |

### Sessions on a specific git branch

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session)-[:ON_BRANCH]->(b:GitBranch {name: 'feature/auth'})
RETURN s.name AS session, s.startedAt AS started,
       s.messageCount AS messages, s.totalOutputTokens AS tokens
ORDER BY s.startedAt DESC
```

Example result:

| session | started | messages | tokens |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Implement OAuth2 flow | 2026-03-28T14:00:00 | 42 | 18500 |
| Add auth middleware | 2026-03-27T09:30:00 | 28 | 12200 |
| Set up auth routes | 2026-03-26T16:15:00 | 35 | 15800 |

## Combining with Other Connectors

The Claude Code connector works alongside other connectors. Combine it with GitHub for a complete development context graph:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-full-dev-graph \
  --domain software-engineering \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --connector claude-code \
  --connector github \
  --claude-code-scope current
```

Now the agent can correlate your Claude Code sessions with GitHub issues, pull requests, and commits -- connecting the *why* (session decisions) with the *what* (code changes).

## Privacy and Security

The Claude Code connector is designed with privacy in mind:

![Data pipeline showing local-only reads, secret redaction, and content truncation](/img/claude-code-data-pipeline.png)

- **Local data only**: All data is read from your local `~/.claude/projects/` directory. Nothing is sent to external services.
- **Secret redaction**: API keys, tokens, passwords, and connection strings are automatically detected and replaced with `[REDACTED]` before storage. This is enabled by default.
- **Content truncation**: By default, message content is truncated to 2000 characters. Use `--claude-code-content none` to store only metadata (no message text at all).
- **Read-only access**: The connector never modifies or deletes your original JSONL files.
- **No external dependencies**: The connector uses only Python's standard library -- no third-party API clients required.

:::caution
If you import sessions into a cloud Neo4j instance (e.g., Neo4j Aura), be aware that your session content -- including code snippets, file paths, and conversation text -- will be stored in the cloud. For sensitive projects, use a local Neo4j instance.
:::

## Re-importing Updated Data

As you create new Claude Code sessions, re-import to keep the graph current:

```bash
# Re-import from Claude Code
make import

# Re-import and seed into Neo4j
make import-and-seed
```

The import uses MERGE operations, so re-importing is safe -- existing nodes are updated rather than duplicated.

:::tip Customizing re-imports via `.env`
To change the import scope after scaffolding, edit the Claude Code settings in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Import all projects (not just current directory)
CLAUDE_CODE_SCOPE=all

# Limit to recent sessions
CLAUDE_CODE_SINCE=2026-04-01

# Import at most 50 sessions
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SESSIONS=50

# Store full message content (default: truncated to 2000 chars)
CLAUDE_CODE_CONTENT_MODE=full
```

These settings only affect `make import` / `make import-and-seed`. The initial scaffold import uses the CLI flags instead.
:::

:::note Session deduplication
Because seed uses `MERGE` by name, re-seeding updates existing nodes rather than creating duplicates. However, sessions that were deleted from `~/.claude/projects/` will remain as stale nodes in Neo4j. To start fresh, run `make reset` before `make import-and-seed`.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### `make seed` fails with a connection error

Ensure Neo4j is running and your `.env` credentials are correct:

```bash
make test-connection
```

If this fails, verify that `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file match your Neo4j instance. For Neo4j Aura, the URI should start with `neo4j+s://`.

### No sessions found during import

The connector looks for session files in `~/.claude/projects/`. Verify you have session data:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/projects/
```

If the directory is empty or doesn't exist, you need to use Claude Code at least once to generate session history.

### `--claude-code-scope current` imports nothing

The `current` scope matches your working directory to a project path in `~/.claude/projects/`. Run the CLI from the same directory where you used Claude Code, or use `--claude-code-project /path/to/project` to specify the project path explicitly.

### Python version error during scaffold

If you see `requires-python >= 3.11` errors, see the Python version guidance in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above.

### Frontend fails to start

Make sure you ran `make install` before `make start`. If the error persists, install frontend dependencies manually:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
```

### Port already in use

The backend uses port 8000 and the frontend uses port 3000. If either port is occupied:

```bash
# Find and kill the process on a specific port
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

## Next Steps

- **Import all projects** -- Use `--claude-code-scope all` to build a cross-project knowledge graph
- **Combine connectors** -- Add `--connector github` or `--connector linear` for the full development lifecycle
- **Customize agent tools** -- Edit the generated `agent.py` to add project-specific Cypher queries
- **Explore the [How Decision Traces Work](/docs/explanation/how-decision-traces-work) explainer** for the conceptual model behind decision extraction across connectors
- **Check the [Claude Code Session Schema](/docs/reference/claude-code-schema) reference** for the complete list of entity types, relationships, and properties
